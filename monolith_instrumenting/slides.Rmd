title: Monolith (instrumenting)
lab: https://github.com/rhildred/INFO8985_monolith

## Agenda

- Review database lab
- Introduce the Challenge/Activity
- Theory to support learning outcomes and the Activity
- Initial demo of activity

Chapter 3 and 5 in the book

## Otel Collector for Database (R)

```yaml
    queries:
      - sql: "SELECT sum(xact_commit+xact_rollback) as count_test FROM pg_stat_database; "
        metrics:
          - metric_name: query_requests # R from REDS
            value_column: count_test
```

## Otel Collector for Database (E)

```yaml
      - sql: "SELECT sum(xact_rollback) as count_test FROM pg_stat_database; "
        metrics:
          - metric_name: query_errors # E from REDS
            value_column: count_test
```

## Monolithic white box Challenge

- Create a codespace from this [github template](`r rmarkdown::metadata$lab`).
- Start with, "Create and launch an HTTP Server," in [the open telemetry python docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/getting-started/)
- When you are done submit the output from the `docker-compose up` window

## Learning Outcomes

- Support traces in a monolithic app by instrumenting so that code traces are available for troubleshooting.
- Measure REDS metrics in monolithic app by adding and incrementing the appropriate counters.
- Integrate language logs by turning them into open telemetry loggers.

## Observability Pipelines

> push data from a process to an instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Filtering, batching, and creating metric views are all accomplished at the Collector rather than in the process itself.

- having said that the semantics of what we push are important
- chapter 3 covers this in some depth

## Pipeline Semantics

## Foundation of OpenTelemetry is built on two points: 

- standards-based context and conventions, 
- alongside a universal data format.
- the telemetry pipeline includes attributes that meet stakeholder needs for observability

## Telemetry Schemas

## Open Telemetry Collector

- can provide schema transformations
- support changes in semantic conventions (and their associated support in analysis tools) 
- without having to reinstrument or redefine output from existing services
