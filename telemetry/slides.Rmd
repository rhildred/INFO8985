## Observability (activity review)

We installed the kubernetes dashboard. From their github:

> Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

- essentially this was a "hello world" for a distributed system using kubernetes ansible and helm
- a pod is the unit of deployment in our case ... see the next slides
