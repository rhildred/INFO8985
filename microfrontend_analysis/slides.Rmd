title: Assignment 1 revisited
lab: https://github.com/rhildred/INFO8985-observable-monolith
---
## Agenda

- THANKS to Punit for working with me on this
- And providing the [worked example](`r rmarkdown::metadata$lab`) that we will go over
- Revisit the marking scheme
- Time to work

## Worked Example

- based on wordpress bitnami helm chart
- overrode the image name in the values

## playbook.yml

```
  - name: Deploy Wordpress chart from bitnami
    kubernetes.core.helm:
      name: wordpress
      chart_ref: oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/wordpress
      release_namespace: default
      values:
        image:
          repository: autoinstrumented-bitnami-wordpress

```

## autoinstrumented-wordpress/Dockerfile

```
RUN pecl install opentelemetry protobuf
COPY otel.php.ini /opt/bitnami/php/etc/conf.d/
# Copy in the composer vendor files and autoload.php
COPY --from=build /app/vendor /var/www/otel
ENV OTEL_PHP_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED=true
ENV OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-wordpress-installation
```
... to install the instrumentation

## revised marking schema

I decided to make this a written assignment with a deployment diagram.
- the revised marking schema is with Punit's fork
- moved back in to my repository

## next week

- we will resume the paypal microfrontend example with logging
- I decided that there wasn't 2 weeks of logging anyways
