title: Monolith (analysis)
lab: https://github.com/rhildred/INFO8985_monolith

## Agenda

- Review database lab
- Introduce the Challenge/Activity
- Theory to support learning outcomes and the Activity
- Initial demo of activity

Chapter 3 and 5 in the book

## Otel Collector for Database

```yaml
    queries:
      - sql: "SELECT sum(xact_commit+xact_rollback) as count_test FROM pg_stat_database; "
        metrics:
          - metric_name: query_requests # R from REDS
            value_column: count_test
      - sql: "SELECT sum(xact_rollback) as count_test FROM pg_stat_database; "
        metrics:
          - metric_name: query_errors # E from REDS
            value_column: count_test
```

## Monolithic white box Challenge

- Create a codespace from this [github template](`r rmarkdown::metadata$lab`).
- Start with, "Create and launch an HTTP Server," in [the open telemetry python docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/getting-started/)
- When you are done submit the output from the `docker-compose up` window

## Learning Outcomes

- Support traces in a monolithic app by instrumenting so that code traces are available for troubleshooting.
- Measure REDS metrics in monolithic app by adding and incrementing the appropriate counters.
- Integrate language logs by turning them into open telemetry loggers.
